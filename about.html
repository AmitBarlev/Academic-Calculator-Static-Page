        <h2>Setting and characters</h2>
        <h3><strong>Paragraph One</strong></h3>
        <p> The show follows the exploits of four boys, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick.
            The boys live in the fictional small town of South Park, located within the real-life South Park basin in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado.
            The town is also home to an assortment of frequent characters such as students, families, elementary school staff, and other various residents,
            who tend to regard South Park as a bland, quiet place to live.Prominent settings on the show include the local elementary school, bus stop,
            various neighborhoods and the surrounding snowy landscape, actual Colorado landmarks, and the shops and businesses along the town's main street,
        all of which are based on the appearance of similar locations in Fairplay.</p>

        <h3><b>Paragraph Two</b></h3>
        <p> Stan is portrayed as the everyman of the group,[8] as the show's website describes him as an "average, American 4th grader".
            [9] Kyle is the lone Jew among the group, and his portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically.
            Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. They are best friends, and their friendship,
            symbolically intended to reflect Parker and Stone's friendship,[10] is a common topic throughout the series.
            Eric Cartman (usually nicknamed by his surname only) is loud, obnoxious, and amoral, often portrayed as an antagonist.
            His anti-Semitic attitude has resulted in a progressive rivalry with Kyle,although the deeper reason is the strong clash between Kyle's strong
            morality and Cartman's complete lack of such.
            Kenny, who comes from a poor family, wears his parka hood so tightly that it covers most of his face and muffles his speech.
            During the show's first five seasons, Kenny would die in nearly every episode before returning in the next with little-to-no definitive explanation given.
            He was written out of the show's sixth season in 2002, re-appearing in the season finale.
            Since then, Kenny's death has been seldom used by the show's creators. During the show's first 58 episodes, the boys were in the third grade.
            In the season four episode "4th Grade" (2000), they entered the fourth grade, but have remained there ever since</p>

            Except for the pilot episode, which was produced using cutout animation, all episodes of South Park are created with the
            use of software, primarily Autodesk Maya. As opposed to the pilot, which took three months to complete,[50] and other animated sitcoms,
            which are traditionally hand-drawn by companies in South Korea in a process that takes roughly eight-to-nine months,[26][34] individual episodes
            of South Park take significantly less time to produce. Using computers as an animation method, the show's production staff were able to generate an
            episode in about three weeks during the first seasons.[51] Now, with a staff of about 70 people, episodes are typically completed in one week,[26][33][34]
            with some in as little as three to four days. [52][53][54] Nearly the entire production of an episode is accomplished within one set of offices, which were
            originally at a complex in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, and are now part of South Park Studios in Culver City, California.[47][50] Parker and Stone have
            been the show's executive producers throughout its entire history.[55] 20th Century Fox Senior Production Executive Debbie Liebling also served as an executive
            producer during the show's first five seasons, coordinating the show's production efforts between South Park Studios and Comedy Central's headquarters in New York
            City
